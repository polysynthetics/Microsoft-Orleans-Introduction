# Apress Introduction to Microsoft Orleans Application

Welcome to Orleans, a virtual actor framework from Microsoft that allows a single developer to create immensely scalable, available applications while maintaining a high throughput. This guide is designed to give you a foundational understanding of Orleans, an overview of its implementations, and plenty of hands-on coding experience. Side-by-side monolithic and microservice patterns alongside Orleans' framework features are also discussed, to help readers without an actor model background understand how they can enhance applications.

This exmaple can be used directly with the book: Introduction to Microsoft Orleans Application.
